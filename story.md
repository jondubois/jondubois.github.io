## Act I: The WordPress Whisperer

Picture this: It's 2011, I'm a broke university student, and I'm building websites for clients who keep asking me the same question: "Why is WordPress so goddamn confusing?"

Not in those exact words, of course. They were more polite. But the subtext was clear: "We hired you to build us a website, not to give us PTSD every time we want to update our opening hours."

Being a clever young developer with delusions of grandeur, I thought: "I'll build them something better!" So I created Jumbo Website Manager—a drag-and-drop CMS that was easier to use than ordering coffee at Starbucks. It had everything clients actually wanted: intuitive editing, a built-in photo editor, and an interface that didn't require a computer science degree to navigate.

I uploaded it to SourceForge (because this was 2011 and GitHub wasn't cool yet) and sat back, waiting for web agencies worldwide to throw parades in my honor.

*Narrator: They did not throw parades.*

Instead, agencies looked at my beautiful, client-friendly solution and collectively decided to stick with WordPress. Why? Because apparently, there's something deeply satisfying about watching your clients suffer through a content management system that feels like it was designed by someone who actively hates joy.

"But our clients keep complaining about WordPress," I'd say.

"Yes," they'd reply, "but we know WordPress."

It was like watching someone choose to eat glass shards because they were familiar with the texture. Or insisting on using a map from 1847 because "we know where the dragons are marked."

Years later, these same agencies were completely obliterated by Weebly and Wix—platforms that offered exactly what I had built, but with venture capital backing and better marketing. The agencies that could have kept their clients by adopting Jumbo instead watched helplessly as those clients discovered they could build websites themselves without requiring a degree in Masochistic Interface Design.

The schadenfreude was so delicious I gained five pounds.

## Act II: The Framework That Could

Undeterred by my first spectacular failure to understand human psychology, I pivoted to building JCombo—a full-stack framework that let you use the same language everywhere. This was before Meteor Framework existed, which means I was either ahead of my time or completely insane. (Spoiler alert: In tech, these are often the same thing.)

When Meteor eventually launched with the kind of fanfare usually reserved for papal visits, I had just started coming to to the contradictory realization that full-stack frameworks were a hard sell. In the long term, developers prefer building blocks to opinionated frameworks. It was a matter of time before the Meteor folks would reach the same conclusion. It's like trying to sell pre-built Lego castles to people who just want the individual bricks so they can build their own spaceship-castle-dinosaur hybrid.

So I extracted the useful part—a real-time RPC engine over WebSockets—and released it as SocketCluster. Finally, something people actually used! Developers deployed it in production, handling thousands of messages per hour. It was like Socket.IO's more responsible older sibling that had its life together.

But here's the punchline: having people use your software and having people *pay* for your software are about as related as having a drivers license and being good at Mario Kart.

SocketCluster was too successful to ignore and too open-source to monetize. It's still running today, helping developers around the world build real-time applications while generating approximately zero dollars for its creator. It's the software equivalent of being a beloved local musician—everyone loves your work, but nobody thinks they should pay for it.

## Act III: The Blockchain Bonanza (Or: How I Accidentally Became a Crypto Bro)

In 2016, a blockchain company called Lisk discovered SocketCluster and decided they needed it for their infrastructure. They hired me to help integrate it, which was great because I was running low on ramen noodles and existential dread.

Lisk positioned itself as "The Ethereum Killer"—which, in retrospect, is like calling yourself "The Beatles Killer" when you're a garage band from suburban Nebraska. But hey, they had energy-efficient proof-of-stake and my SocketCluster technology, so maybe they could pull it off?

Turns out, they could! Sort of. Lisk rocketed into the top 10 cryptocurrencies globally, hitting a $4 billion market cap. I transitioned from employee to delegate validator, earning passive income for several years just for helping secure the network. Finally, I thought, I've found the sweet spot where my technology is useful *and* profitable! Those sweet crypto tokens flowed through SocketCluster like blood through arteries—my real-time messaging system had become the circulatory backbone of their entire blockchain ecosystem. Just as oxygen-rich blood carries life to every cell in the body, SocketCluster carried transaction data, consensus messages, and network updates to every node in Lisk's distributed organism. The network pulsed with activity: heartbeat-like block confirmations, the steady rhythm of delegate rotations, and the occasional adrenaline rush of major market movements that sent transaction volumes spiking through the system like a runner's elevated pulse.

For a glorious few years, I lived the crypto dream. My SocketCluster nodes hummed along, validating transactions and minting rewards while I slept. I upgraded from store-brand ramen to the fancy stuff with the little vegetable packets. I even bought a chair that didn't require duct tape to stay upright.

Feeling confident, I launched Leasehold—a tokenized real estate platform. We raised just enough money to buy a rental apartment in South Africa, pioneering what would later become a massive trend. Then COVID hit like a meteor, freezing investment and turning rental income into rental *wishes*.

Note to self: The universe has a dark sense of humor about timing.

## Act IV: The Betrayal (This Is Where Things Get Spicy)

Flush with delegate earnings and apparently addicted to being slightly ahead of my time, I built Capitalisk—a quantum-resistant cryptocurrency with its own DEX. This wasn't just another "DogeCoin But With Hats" project; it was serious infrastructure preparing for the very real threat that quantum computing poses to current blockchain security.

We wanted to connect it to the Lisk ecosystem because, you know, rising tides lift all boats and all that collaborative nonsense.

The Lisk founders had other plans. Plans that involved setting my project on fire while telling everyone it was a controlled burn.

They openly defamed me and Capitalisk, spreading lies that would make a political campaign blush. "Their solution doesn't work!" they proclaimed, despite it working perfectly. It was like watching someone claim the sky is green while standing under a blue sky—audacious in its disconnection from reality.

But here's where the story gets so absurd it loops back to being tragic: After destroying my project for supposedly not working and being too similar to their vision, the Lisk founders eventually abandoned their entire technology stack and migrated to... *drumroll please*... **Ethereum**.

The "Ethereum Killer" became Ethereum's little sidekick. It was like watching someone spend years trash-talking Marvel movies, then getting a job as Spider-Man's stunt double.

They had sold investors on a vision, crushed me for actually building toward that vision, then gave up and joined the competitor. Meanwhile, Capitalisk—which actually aligned with their original promises—was left to die in the shadows like a forgotten side character in a soap opera.

The community's lack of outrage was suspicious. When billions of dollars are involved and founders make such dramatic strategic pivots, you'd expect *some* noise. The silence suggested that checkbooks might have been involved...

I didn't pursue legal action because when people are willing to lie about someone who helped build their fortunes, it raises uncomfortable questions about what else they might be willing to do. Sometimes discretion is the better part of not getting mysteriously food poisoned.

## Act V: The Current Comedy of Errors

Today, I maintain Capitalisk on the side, generating precisely zero income while keeping quantum-resistant technology alive for when the world realizes it needs it (probably around the time quantum computers start cracking Bitcoin like walnuts).

My current project, Saasufy, is Jumbo Website Manager's spiritual successor, which means I'm apparently trapped in the entrepreneurial equivalent of Groundhog Day. It's a no-code platform that handles all the boring-but-critical stuff: multi-tenancy, real-time updates, authentication, security, scaling. You know, the parts that make software actually work in the real world instead of just in demos.

But the market has been monopolized faster than you can say "venture capital oligopoly." Getting anyone to try an alternative is like trying to convince people to switch from their favorite social media platform because yours has better privacy policies. Technically correct, practically impossible.

So I built Insnare, a people discovery platform, entirely on Saasufy to prove that you can build complex, production-ready applications without writing backend code. It's like building a house to prove your construction tools work, except the neighborhood association has banned anyone from looking at houses not built by the three pre-approved contractors.

## Act VI: The AI Wave

The current AI hype around application building is giving me the strongest déjà vu since I ate that suspicious mushroom in college. Everyone's losing their minds over "build an app in 10 minutes!" while completely ignoring the fact that building the app is maybe 5% of the problem.

The real challenges—adding features, maintenance, security, not having your application turn into a digital house of cards—are about as exciting to the market as watching paint dry in real-time. But hey, who needs security when you can generate a todo app that looks like every other todo app but with slightly different CSS?

Saasufy provides exactly the guardrails that would make AI-generated applications actually viable in production. But it's not getting adoption because it lacks the most important feature in modern tech: a marketing budget the size of a small country's GDP.

People are churning out AI-generated applications like a factory with broken quality control, creating a security disaster that will make the Equifax breach look like a minor paperwork mishap. When hackers start using AI to identify vulnerabilities in AI-generated code (which is basically like giving a burglar the blueprints to every house in the neighborhood), the carnage will be spectacular.

But by then, most companies will be too busy dealing with breach lawsuits to invest in proper solutions.

## The Pattern Recognition Olympics

After fifteen years of this, I've identified a clear pattern: I consistently build exactly what the market needs, then watch it choose the equivalent of setting money on fire while complaining about being cold.

It's like being a time traveler who keeps trying to warn people about obvious disasters, except instead of grateful appreciation, you get blank stares and suggestions to "try being more positive."

The tech industry pretends to be rational and meritocratic, but my experience suggests it's more like a high school popularity contest run by people with unlimited budgets and questionable judgment. Success depends less on solving real problems and more on having the right logo, the right investors, and being part of whatever everyone's talking about this week.

Strategy, it turns out, is often just elaborate fortune-telling when you're dealing with markets that make decisions like they're playing pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey while blindfolded and slightly drunk.

## The Eternal Question

So what do you do when you keep being right at spectacularly wrong times? When you build exactly what the market needs, only to watch it choose the technological equivalent of a chocolate teapot because it came with better marketing?

I could open-source Saasufy, but SocketCluster taught me that "free" plus "useful" doesn't automatically equal "adopted." It's more likely to equal "free labor for people who will never mention your name."

I could target enterprise customers who theoretically value substance over style, but they want expensive certifications that prove you're secure, not actual security. It's like requiring a diploma to prove you can read when you've already written a novel.

I could write a book about these experiences, though given my track record, it would probably become a cult classic that influences a generation of developers while selling twelve copies.

Or I could just keep building, maintaining my projects at minimal cost, and waiting for the inevitable moment when reality crashes the party and everyone suddenly remembers that flashy demos don't run production systems.

History suggests that moment always comes. The question is whether anyone will remember the solutions that were sitting there all along, quietly working while everyone else was chasing unicorns.

The Cassandra complex is alive and well in tech: being cursed to see problems clearly while being powerless to convince anyone to solve them until it's too late and much more expensive.

## Epilogue: The Great Escape (Or: How I Learned to Let Someone Else Bang Their Head Against the Wall)

Plot twist: I'm now taking a break from the beautiful madness of the tech entrepreneurship scene, like a war correspondent who's decided to cover flower shows for a while. I've joined an AI company as an employee—yes, employee, that mystical creature who gets paid regularly and doesn't have to explain to their therapist why they're emotionally attached to server uptime metrics.
It's wonderfully liberating to let other people deal with the impossible task of finding product-market fit while I focus on the much simpler challenge of building things that work. Watching someone else navigate the "our revolutionary AI will change everything!" conversations while I quietly write code in the background feels like being a reformed gambler who now just watches poker on TV—all the entertainment, none of the financial ruin.
